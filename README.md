# Solar Dashboard

The **Solar Dashboard** explores the performance of my home's solar panel and backup battery system.

### About

The dashboard is composed entirely of Markdown text documents and hosted using
[markdown-up](https://github.com/craigahobbs/markdown-up#readme).
It makes extensive use of markdown-up's markdown-charts, live-rendered charts from special fenced
code blocks.

The dashboard source code is
